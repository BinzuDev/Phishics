This is a style guide for the Phishics project so that we can have uniform code across developers

Its mostly the same as godot's recommended style guide with a few differences:
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html




NAMING CONVENTIONS: (* means its different from Godot's Style Guide)

   Code:
* variables: camelCase 
functions/signals: snake_case
classes: PascalCase
consts/enums: CAPITAL_CASE


   Files:
* root folder names: PascalCase
sub-folder names: snake_case
file names: snake_case
* playable levels: Pascal_Snake_Case  (to tell appart from test/debug levels)



Breaking these conventions is fine for obviously temporary assets,
it lets us know that we can eventually delete it.

Some very important assets are allowed exceptions so they stand out more.
ex: GAME_MANAGER.gd and Fish.tscn/Fish.gd


  ####>> NEVER EVER PUT SPACES IN FOLDER OR FILE NAMES!!!! <<####

-> MAKE SURE THAT THE NAME OF THE ROOT NODE IS THE SAME AS THE FILE NAME <-
Ex: root node of Anchor_Hills.tscn is called "Anchor_Hills"


When naming variations of things, write the variation LAST
(even if it doesnt make sense grammatically)

Bad ex:
broken_coral
flat_coral
tube_coral
tree_coral

Good ex:
coral_broken
coral_flat
coral_tube
coral_tree

This is because files are sorted ALPHABETICALLY.
Doing this insures variations of the same thing are grouped together.



When something has multiple versions, the first one needs a 1 at the end
(this might sound silly and obvious but this is A REAL EXAMPLE I had to fix)

Bad ex:
scope_close2
scope_cloes3
scope_close
scope_open2
scope_open

Good ex:
scope_close1
scope_close2
scope_close3
scope_open1
scope_open2

This is because when sorting alphabetically, the one with no numbers gets put after the numbered ones




Declare classes like this:
class_name Database extends Resource

not:
extends Resource

class_name Database



"not" and "!" can be used interchangably.
But typically, I'll only use "not" when it makes sense grammatically

bad ex:
if !visible:
if not has_focus

good ex:
if not visible
if !has_focus

Always use "!" when setting a variable
ex: value = !value
